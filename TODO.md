Assignment 3 - Australia Zoo Team Grade

Note: this is a group assignment, so the grades available are icke godkänt and godkänt only.

The local djurpark is hosting an exhibition of Australian animals and want to raise awareness by publishing a website.​ The exhibition will feature a minimum of 9 animals from 3 different groups of animals.

The website will consist of:​

a home page​
a page detailing the mammals​
a page details the birds​
a page detailing the reptiles
a page about your team

Attached are 3 files detailing 9 animals. Add more if you like, but your site MUST use these 9 animals and these animal groups.

Common Elements:

Each page should have a header with a logo​
Each page should have a navigational menu with links to “home”, "birds", "mammals", "reptiles" and "about us".
Each page should have a footer with some content.​
Each page should have a side bar and a main content area – the content of both of these areas will be different for each page, but the pages should share a common layout,

Home Page
