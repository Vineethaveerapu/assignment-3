            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>Right at home. Southern cassowaries inhabit rainforests of northeastern Australia and the island of New Guinea, as well as the Indonesian islands of Ceram and Aru. Generally, cassowaries are associated with dense, tropical rainforest, with a penchant for old growth forest. The southern variety may also be found in lowland forests, savannas, forest edges and riverbanks, and even mangroves and fruit plantations.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="cassowary-behaviour" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>The low down.  Cassowaries produce some of the lowest-frequency sounds of any bird. Given its solitary behavior, the low frequency may help the sound travel a greater distance to the closest cassowary, so it can respond appropriately—like avoid them completely or pursue mating possibilities. Most calls are associated with breeding, including the “boo-boo-boo” song with accompanying stamping feet.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="cassowary-feeding" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>Cassowaries mostly feast on fallen fruit, snails, and fungi, but when they have high-protein cravings, they feed on small mammals and reptiles, dead or alive. They use their feet to scour the forest floor for a meal. Being largely dependent on fruit, they need diverse forest habitat with plants that supply food all year long. One study in Queensland revealed that southern cassowaries consume fruits of at least 75 different types of forest plants. When food becomes scarce, cassowaries will raid gardens, orchards, and commercial crops like bananas and mulberries.</p>

              The Laughing Kookaburra inhabits most areas where there are suitable trees</p>
          </div>
          <div id="kookaburra-behaviour" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>In eastern Australia, the raucous cackle of the Laughing Kookaburra is an essential feature of the dawn chorus. They can be heard laughing from the tip of Cape York south to Wilsons Promontory.

              The species occurrence in other parts of Australia, however, is no laughing matter. Kookaburras were widely introduced into Tasmania and Western Australia where they breed in tree hollows that would usually be used by parrots and owls, and they prey on small reptiles, mammals and nestlings, thus placing undue pressure on those creatures.
              
              The Laughing Kookaburra is not really laughing when it makes its familiar call. The cackle of the Laughing Kookaburra is actually a territorial call to warn other birds to stay away.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="kookaburra-feeding" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>Laughing Kookaburras feed mostly on insects, worms and crustaceans, although small snakes, mammals, frogs and birds may also be eaten.

              Prey is seized by pouncing from a suitable perch. Small prey is eaten whole, but larger prey is killed by bashing it against the ground or tree branch.</p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>The Yellow-Tailed Black-Cockatoo is one of six species of Black-Cockatoo in Australia. In recent years it has been in rapid decline because of native habitat clearance, with a loss of food supply and nest sites.</p>

          <div id="cockatoo-feeding" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Feeding</h3>
            <p>Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoos feed in small to large, noisy flocks. The favoured food is seeds of native trees and pinecones, but birds also feed on the seeds of ground plants. Some insects are also eaten.</p>
